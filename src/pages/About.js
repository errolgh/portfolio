            My name is Ryan Postell, I am the owner and sole developer of Oak Harbor Web Designs based in Seattle, WA. I got into programming after my wife had our first child. I was and still am a stay-at-home dad, and I wanted a career that I can do from home and still be there with the kids to watch them grow up. So over the course of two years I taught myself how to code websites the right way by hand and just started calling small businesses to offer my help.

What I found was that a lot of small businesses don't have the funds to spend thousands of dollars upfront on a new website. And the ones that did, got taken advantage of and have a terrible website that looks like it was built by someone in a dungeon and haven't seen design trends for the last 10 years. They were in a frustrating spot - they either can't afford a good website, and if they can they don't know who to trust to make something great. So I tweaked my business model to fit their needs. That's how I came up with my $0 down and $150 a month model. It's more managable for a small business to handle and won't hurt their bank accounts.
