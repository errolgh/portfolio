            <p>
            My name is Errol Watson. I'm currently based in Baltimore, Maryland. I am the sole developer of this site.
            I got into programming after building my first gaming PC.
            The build was relatively easy and mostly anticlimactic, thusly, after it was up and running,
            I became more curious about how all the pieces in my computer and its applications worked.
            I'm grateful for finding programming because I am the kind of person who enjoys deep dives into new subjects,&nbsp;
            and programming is <span style={{"font-style": "italic"}}>deep.</span>&nbsp;
            I wanted to build a career that I could do from home if necessary and spend less time in someone else's idea of a work environment.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            So over the course of the years I've taken courses, bootcamps, and taught myself how to build websites and web applications.
            Now it's time to offer my help to you.
            {/* What I found was that a lot of small businesses don't have the funds to spend thousands of dollars upfront on a new website.
            And many of those who did, were taken advantage of and have a website that inherited ancient design trends.
            They were in a frustrating spot - they either can't afford a good website, and if they can they don't know who to trust to make something great.&nbsp;
            So I tweaked my business model to fit their needs. That's how I came up with my $0 down and $150 a month model.
            It's more managable for a small business to handle and won't hurt their bank accounts.  */}
